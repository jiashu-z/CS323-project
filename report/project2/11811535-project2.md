### Array Related Rules

First, assign the correct type to the node of the array variable.

```c
VarDec: VarDec LB INT RB { assignIDArrayType($1); };
```

Then, if type of the variable to be added to the symbol table is `Array`, the correct **symbol object** will be generated according to array dimension and the definition of data structure. Take the `int` as an example, the logic is as follows:

```c
Symbol *getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol():
    if children.size > 1:
    	baseSymbol = getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol(node -> child);
    	return new Symbol(symbolName, SymbolType::ARRAY, new ARRAYtype());
    else:
    	return new Symbol("", SymbolType::INT, new IntType());
Symbol *getArrSymbol():
    baseSymbol = getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol();
    return new Symbol(symbolName, SymbolType::ARRAY, new ARRAYtype());
```

The function is recursive and distinguishes between one-dimensional arrays and multi-dimensional arrays in order to support multi-dimensional arrays. In the process of recursion, the **depth**  and **size** of the array will be maintained.

1. The variable that records the **depth** is passed in with the recursive function, and its value changes with the recursive process and is recorded in the data structure.

   ```c
   Symbol *getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol():
       if children.size > 1:
           depth += 1;
   		...
       else:
       	depth = 0;
       	...
   ```

2. The **size** will be recorded in an array during the recursion process due to the combination order of the productions, and will be assigned after the recursion.

   ```c
   void changeMultiDimArrSize(Symbol *symbol, std::vector<int> &sizes):
       if children.size == 1:
           change size
       else:
           changeMultiDimArrSize(symbol->child, sizes);
           change size
   ```

In the end, array related rules will be checked in the following production:

```c
Exp: Exp LB Exp RB { checkAndUpdateExpArray($$,$1,$3,symbolTable); }
```

1. Since the type is stored in the symbol table, rule 10 can be checked by looking up the table using the variable name.
2. Rule 12 is implemented in the same way as above.

### Structure Related Rules

## Bonus Feature

### Function Declaration

### Out-of-bounds Array Access

The location of the visit can be obtained through the production. Since the size of the array is stored in the symbol table, a simple comparison can tell whether the access is out of range

### Equivalence of Arrays of Different Dimensions

After each array access, the type and depth of the variable on the left side of the equal sign will be updated.

```c
ArrayType *updateArrExpType(SyntaxTreeNode *leftExpNode, SyntaxTreeNode *rightExpNode):
	Symbol *arraySymbol = rightExpNode->symbol;
	leftExpNode->symbol = arraySymbol->data->baseType;
```

Since the depth of the array is stored in the symbol table, a simple comparison can tell whether the arrays on both sides of the equal sign have the same depth.

### Structure Equivalence

## Test Case Design

A total of 10 test cases were defined and all 15 rules were checked. Our test case contains far more than 8semantic errors.
