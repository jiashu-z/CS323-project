## Symbol Table Design

We implemented symbol table as hashmaps, key is corresponding varieble name, value is the pointer to our self-defined
class `Symbol`, which using C++ 17 feature variant(similar to union). DATA is corresponding data, name is variable name,
and a enumerate class to indicate the data type.

### Symbol Class

```c++
class Symbol {
 public:
  using DATA = std::variant<IntType*, FloatType*, CharType*, ArrayType*,
                            StructType*, FunctionType*>;
  std::string name;
  SymbolType symbolType = SymbolType::UNKNOWN;
  DATA symbolData;
};
```

### Symbol Table Class

```c++
class SymbolTable {
public:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Symbol *> currentVariableTable;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Symbol *> currentFunctionDefinitionTable;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Symbol *> currentFunctionDeclarationTable;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Symbol *> currentStructDefinitionTable;
};
```

## Semantic Analysis Implementation

### Undefined & Redefined

We have added a function to the action where `ExtDef` and `Def` are the head of products , which is used to process the
statements handling variables and functions using.

### Type Check

For statements such as function calling, expression assignment and returning In the syntax tree node, we added the
attribute symbol, and then we defined actions to increase the comparison expression node in the relevant productions. If
the types are different, a corresponding error will be reported.

### Function Related Rules

In such productions below, we handle function definition action, create a `FunctionType` Symbol and insert it to Symbol
table.

```
ExtDef: Specifier FunDec CompSt
```

In such productions below, we handle function calling action, which will search for `FunctionType` Symbol and do some
error checking.

```
 EXP: ID LP Args RP 
 EXP:ID LP RP
```

### Array Related Rules

First, assign the correct type to the node of the array variable.

```c
VarDec: VarDec LB INT RB { assignIDArrayType($1); };
```

Then, if type of the variable to be added to the symbol table is `Array`, the correct **symbol object** will be
generated according to array dimension and the definition of data structure. Take the `int` as an example, the logic is
as follows:

```c
Symbol *getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol():
    if children.size > 1:
    	baseSymbol = getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol(node -> child);
    	return new Symbol(symbolName, SymbolType::ARRAY, new ARRAYtype());
    else:
    	return new Symbol("", SymbolType::INT, new IntType());
Symbol *getArrSymbol():
    baseSymbol = getMultiDimArrBaseSymbol();
    return new Symbol(symbolName, SymbolType::ARRAY, new ARRAYtype());
```

The function is recursive and distinguishes between one-dimensional arrays and multi-dimensional arrays in order to support multi-dimensional arrays. In the process of recursion, the **depth**  and **size** of the array will be maintained.

1. The variable that records the **depth** is passed in with the recursive function, and its value changes with the recursive process and is recorded in the data structure.

2. The **size** will be recorded in an array during the recursion process due to the combination order of the productions, and will be assigned after the recursion.


In the end, array related rules will be checked in the following production:

```c
Exp: Exp LB Exp RB { checkAndUpdateExpArray($$,$1,$3,symbolTable); }
```

1. Since the type is stored in the symbol table, rule 10 can be checked by looking up the table using the variable name.
2. Rule 12 is implemented in the same way as above.

### Structure Related Rules

Because we implemented structural equivalence feature, we will discuss the feature in bonus part.

## Bonus Feature

We implemented 6 new feature, and these are some new error type we have defined:

| Error Type | description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 16         | undefined struct type                        |
| 17         | array index out of range                     |
| 18         | unmatched function declaration               |
| 19         | can not continue/break in non-loop statement |
| 20         | function missing return statement            |

### 1. Function Declaration

Our function declaration feature can handle statement such as:

```C++
int declare(int a);
int declare(int a){
    return a;
}
```

To implement this, we need to define a new product:

```json
ExtDef: Specifier FunDec SEMI //new product
ExtDef: Specifier FunDec CompSt // origin function definition product
```

and we define a new hashmap called:

```c++
    hashmap<std::string, Symbol *> functionDeclarationTable;
```

, which will handle function declaration. Both function declaration and definition symbol will be insert into function
declaration table, but only if`FunDec ` is in function definition product, we insert function symbol into function
definition symbol table.

We need to handle one more error type: unmatched function declaration. Therefore, we only need to compare whether the
function signatures are consistent when inserting the function declaration.

```c++
int declare1(int a1);
int declare2(int a2);
int declare1(int a,int b){ // line 3 
    return a+b;
}
int declare2(int a3){ //line6
    return a;
}
int main(){
    int c;
    c=declare1(1,2);
    return 0;
}
```

Result:

```json
Error type 18 at Line 3: unmatched function declaration
```

As we can see, line 3 will report error, but line 6 will not. This shows that our implementation is correct.

### 2. Out-of-bounds Array Access

The location of the visit can be obtained through the production. Since the size of the array is stored in the symbol
table, a simple comparison can tell whether the access is out of range.

For example:

```c++
//bonus 2: array length boundary check
int main(){
int array[10];
return array[10];
}
```

Report:

```json
Error type 17 at Line 3: index out of range: 10, array length:10
```

### 3. Equivalence of Arrays of Different Dimensions

After each array access, the type and depth of the variable on the left side of the equal sign will be updated.

Since the depth of the array is stored in the symbol table, a simple comparison can tell whether the arrays on both
sides of the equal sign have the same depth.

For example:

```c++
int test_05(){
    int a[3][5];
    int b[5][4][6];
    a=b; //line 5
    return 0;
}
```

This will report:

```json
Error type 5 at Line 5: unmatching type on both sides of assignment
```

### 4. `struct` Structure Equivalence

For structure equivalence, we firstly compare the number of members in each struct, if they are not equal, we just
return false; else we compare the member's type in each definition in order recursively. For example:

```c++
struct A{
    int a1;
    float a2[5];
};
struct B{
    struct A b[10];
};
struct C{
    int c1;
    float c2[5];
};
struct D{
    struct C d[10];
};
int test_05(){
    struct A st1;
    struct B st2;
    struct C st3;
    st1=st2;  //line 20
    st1=st3; //line 21
    return 0;
}
```

As we can see, line 20 will report an error, but line 18 will not.

```json
Error type 5 at Line 20: unmatching type on both sides of assignment
```

This a little complex example proves our new feature works correctly.

### 5. Break and continue statement checking

We support `break` and `continue` key word, and those two statements can only in `FOR` and `WHILE` scope.To implement
this, we just visit each`stmt` node in pre-order, and give a `isInLoop`flag. If the statement is loop, set the flag and
give it to children node; if the statement is break or continue, we check the flag, if it is false, we report an error.

```C++
int test_1_r10()
{
  int a=10;
  int i = 0;
  break;  //line5
  continue;//line6
  while (i < a)
  {
    i = i + 1;
    if(i<5){
        continue; //line11
    }
    else{
        break;//line14
    }
   }
   break; //line17
   continue;//line18
   return 0;
}
```

```json
Error type 19 at Line 5: can not break in non-loop statement
Error type 19 at Line 6: can not continue in non-loop statement
Error type 19 at Line 17: can not break in non-loop statement
Error type 19 at Line 18: can not continue in non-loop statement
```

As we can see, line 5,6,17,18 will report errors, while line 11 and 14 will not.

### 6. Missing return statement checking.

In our context context-free grammar, every function should have return value, we difine a new error type to check
whehter a function have at least one return statement. If not, we report an error.
